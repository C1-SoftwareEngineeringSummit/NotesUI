# NotesUI

Since you will be learning a pletheora of information during Capital One's software engineering summit, let's build an iOS app for taking notes. During this workshop we'll cover the basics of Swift, iOS, SwiftUI, and building apps with Xcode.

## Requirements

This project has been updated to work with iOS 13, Xcode 11.4.1, and Swift 5.2.

## Content

In this repo, you'll find two versions of the NotesUI App: a starter project and the completed project.

To get started, open the `NotesUI-Starter.xcodeproj` file located in the `NotesUI-Starter` directory. Please refer to the [Step By Step Instructions](NotesUI-Starter/StepByStepInstructions.md) for detailed instructions on building this app. During the workshop you can use these instructions to follow along.

## Bonus Functionality

If you're feeling up to it, here is some additionaly functionality to work on.

### Add Persistence

As you've probably noticed by now, when you close the app and re-open it, all of your data is gone. In order to save all your data you'll need to add persistence. There are many options available to accomplish this. Here are some options:
  
* [NSUserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults)
* [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html)
* [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
